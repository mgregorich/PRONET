# Framework to study graph-theoretical features of individual-specific networks for prediction modelling

## Background

The simulation study examines the use of graph-theoretical features
extracted from individual-specific networks for prognostic prediction
modelling. In particular, the study focuses on individual-specific
network sparsification, which is mostly performed in applied data
analysis by selecting any fixed cutoff value. We propose a flexible
parameterization of the graph-theoretical features generated by a
sequential sparsification and investigate whether it provides an
improvement in terms of the prediction performance of the model.
